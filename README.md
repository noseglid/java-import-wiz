# java-import-wiz

Works together with [autocomplete-java-minus](https://github.com/noseglid/autocomplete-java-minus) to insert imports after autocompleting.

## Getting started

To use this package you only need to install it and `autocomplete-java-minus`.
Once you've setup `autocomplete-java-minus` so that it provides autocomplete
suggestions, they will automatically be imported.
